# AI VLookUp

This project provides a multi-data structure backed approach to tackle efficient fuzzy matching in tables; with its engine backed by HashMaps, Tokenization, Jaccard, and Damerau plus small group sorting this approach is capable of creating its own database for fuzzy look up; which is then used to query itself in order to solve the most optimal mapping between entries of two different tables.

## Example usage

Letâ€™s say we have the following tables [Incomplet_Table](./Sample_Dataset/Primary_Reference_Table.csv)<!-- {"preview":"true"} -->
